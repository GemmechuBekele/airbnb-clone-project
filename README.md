## ⚙️ Technology Stack

Below is a breakdown of the core technologies used in this project, each playing a specific role in building a scalable, secure, and performant booking platform.

### 🔹 Django
- A high-level Python web framework used for rapid backend development.
- Provides built-in tools for authentication, ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), and admin interfaces.

### 🔹 Django REST Framework (DRF)
- An extension of Django that simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs.
- Handles serialization, authentication, permissions, and request/response cycles efficiently.

### 🔹 PostgreSQL
- A powerful, open-source relational database system used for data storage.
- Handles complex queries and provides strong consistency and ACID compliance.

### 🔹 GraphQL
- A query language for APIs that allows clients to request only the data they need.
- Enables flexible and efficient frontend-backend communication.

### 🔹 Celery
- A task queue system used for executing asynchronous tasks in the background.
- Handles operations like sending confirmation emails or processing payments.

### 🔹 Redis
- An in-memory data store used as a caching layer and message broker for Celery.
- Enhances performance by reducing database load for frequently accessed data.

### 🔹 Docker
- A containerization platform used to package the application and its dependencies.
- Ensures consistency across development, testing, and production environments.

### 🔹 CI/CD Pipelines (GitHub Actions)
- Automates code testing, building, and deployment processes.
- Ensures continuous integration and delivery of new features with minimal manual intervention.
